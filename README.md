# MTH1001 in Lean, 2024/25

The material in this repository complements the in-person MTH1001 (Mathematical Structures)
lectures.

All relevant Lean files are in subfolders of the Mth10012024 folder. The simplest way to use the
files is to copy their content into the [Lean 4 web editor](https://live.lean-lang.org).
